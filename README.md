# Yorùbá Gender Recognition from Speech using Neural Networks
Published in [IEEE 2019 6th Intl. Conference on Soft Computing & Machine Intelligence (ISCMI 2019)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9004376)

This paper uses speech to build a gender recognition system based on neural networks. Three types of neural networks are investigated to find the best model for gender recognition system using Yorùbá, namely, feed-forward artificial neural networks (Multilayer Perceptrons), Recurrent neural networks (long short-term memory), and Convolutional neural networks. All the classifier models obtained the state-of-the-art performance in speech-based gender recognition with 99% in accuracy and F1 score.
